/**
 * The regular `UTapGestureRecognizer` has a slight delay built in after a finger has left the screen so that it can detect multiple taps (double-taps, triple-taps) without triggering the delegate multiple times (e.g. no single tap delegate call when double tapped). Sometimes, in games, however, you want to know the second any finger touches the screen so that there's no delay. This simple gesture recognizer tells you immediately if a finger touches the screen or is removed from the scren. All it tells you is which finger where it touched. That touch may end up being part of another gesture, so it's your responsibility to make sure the tap doesn't have any unintended side effects. The GestureEndedDelegate is used to tell the delegate when any finger has been taken off the screen, and GestureStartedDelegate is used to tell the delegate when a finger has first touched the screen.
